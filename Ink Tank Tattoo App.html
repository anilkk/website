<h3> DESIGN PROCESS </h3>

  <img src="img/design process.png" alt= "design" style="width:700px;height:400px">

<div><p>The designing process is like a puzzle. Each piece has a major role in creating the final product and a very precise spot where to fit in. You can't have a puzzle if the pieces are missing or a beautifully clear image of the product if the pieces don't match.</p></div>
<div><p1> User Experience Design has the same concept. You can't create a successful product if you have not gone through all the stages of the design process. And each step I made taught me something: </p1></div>
<div></p2>- from interviews and surveys, I learned how to communicate with the user, create a pleasant environment and determine him or her to answer my questions </p2></div>
<div></p3>- from usability tests I found out that is better to participate in the test than explaining to the user what has to do; better results and less time wasted </p2></div>
<div></p4>- creating a user persona will help you to focus on user needs and goals </p4></div>
<div></p5>- the wireframes taught me that each detail counts: the colors, the font, the spacing are closely related </p5></div>
<div></p6>- asking for feedback is always a good idea as long as users are familiar with the product or al least with the concept </p6></div>
<div></p7>- the final result has to be accessible for any type of user and in the end </p7></div>
<div></p8>- designing has to be a fun process: use colors, sketch, meet new people, interact with the stakeholders, ask for feedback, be open to critics, and always try to improve yourself. </p8></div>

<div></p9>If someone would ask me: "what would you do differently next time?" probably I will say that I will ask for feedback more often. Always keep in touch with the designers, ask for their opinion but don't forget that the user is the one who matters. So it's very important to  know from the beginning user needs and goals to have a successful product. And keep in mind that not always users and designers have the same vision, opinions, or ideas regarding the product.</p9></div>
